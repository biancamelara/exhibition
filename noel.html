<h2>1.Reflections</h2>
		 <p style="color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff">Reading the following will inform you why I choose pictures and meanings that I have on my interviewee's portarit</p>
<p> -The pictures that i choose to put in this portrait represents my interviewee in differnt ways. it shows her bravery her leadeership, and things that are important to her. such as images of where she grew up.</p>

<p style="color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff"><p style="color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff">Why did I choose these images</p></p>
<P> -For this portrait I wanted to incorporate alot of things that are meanful to her<p/>
<p> -Instead of just adding pictures scattered everywhere I wanted to place them in places that make a story that represents my interviewee</P>
<p> -Looking at the portrait the main focuse is the image of two people on a mountain.Person #2 is already all the way at the top helping person #1 up the mountain:by holding their hand and giving them support. Person #2 represents my interviewee helping the women that were bound to addiction get free. In person #1 I put pictures of things that their going through like drinking,drugs,and more.In the mountain I put images of things that they are conquering. evrytime they take a step they conquer that area situation .</p>
